# Attempt to predict the a scatter graph

###### Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict the value in a scatter graph

## Vision before attempt

### Creating training Test and Train data sets

- Use a simple python command to apply a random function to a curve
 Example : Y = rand(0,1)\*(m\*X + c)
- Use this is data generated to create a database to train + test from
- Separate the train and test data
- Save this data using pickle so that it does not have to be re-created again

### Visualizing the Data

- Use Matplot library to plot the scatter graph and see

### Create and train a model

- Not sure which model is best and how to use them so this tab will be filled later when I figure it out using video lectures and resources

### Use the model to predict and see if it works

- Just see if it works

### Finally

- Come back to this document later to reflect how much of it I was able to preserve and make it happen. And write a final post-project document
